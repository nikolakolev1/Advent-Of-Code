# Advent-Of-Code
Here I will be posting my (Java) solutions to the AoC :)


# 2022
This year is my first time attempting the challenge, and I find it fascinating! I decided to use the competition to learn how to use ![IntelliJ IDEA](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJIDEA-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=intellij-idea&logoColor=white).
However, I am not a programmer, nor do I have exceptional knowledge in the sphere. Expect my code to be longer than necessary, and the tasks to be divided into lots of smaller parts, which I find easier to solve.

# 2023
